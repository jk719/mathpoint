# MathPoint Conceptual Diagnosis System â€” Summary

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**  
Diagnose a student's true conceptual understanding in math (not just correct answers) using AI, machine learning, and smart data analysis.

---

## System Design Overview

1. **Multi-Layered Assessment Approach**  
   - Smart Multiple Choice: Wrong choices reveal specific misconceptions.  
   - Micro-Tasks: Drag and drop, categorization, matching.  
   - Structured Open-Ended Prompts: Light explanation requests after warming up.  
   - Error Analysis: Students find mistakes in worked-out problems.  
   - Concept Mapping: Visual connections between related ideas.

2. **Rich Behavioral Data Collection**  
   - Time per question  
   - Hesitation, change of answer patterns  
   - Sequence of actions (clicks, drags, typing)  
   - Open-ended response quality

3. **Machine Learning Model Applications**  
   - Misconception Detection (decision trees, random forests)  
   - Concept Mastery Prediction (logistic regression, boosting)  
   - Open-Ended Analysis (NLP models: BERT, GPT)  
   - Adaptive Assessment Routing (reinforcement learning)

4. **Knowledge Graphs (Concept Maps)**  
   - Nodes = concepts (fractions, ratios)  
   - Edges = relationships and dependencies  
   - Dynamically update as student progresses

5. **Progressive Diagnosis**  
   - Early-stage suggestions refined over time  
   - Confidence updates as more data arrives
